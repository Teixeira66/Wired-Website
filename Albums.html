  <h2> Wired 1</h2>
  <p> Sarah was the biggest fan of her dad's blues band and as a kid spent many a Sunday afternoon hanging out with the band. Following a brief foray into nursing, she now leads the communications work of a number of young startups around Geneva. Sarah's unique voice has been described as a mix of Evanescence's Amy Lee with a Chris Cornell-like edge. </p>

  <p> John began his musical career learning classical guitar at the age of 6. At 12 years old he switched to the bass and became more and more interested in the hard rock classics from AC/DC, Van Halen and Metallica. When heâ€™s not playing or rehearsing with the band he can be found with a spade or rake, running his own gardening business.</p>

  <h2> Wired 4 </h2>
  <p> Luis was banging on anything and everything before he can remember and was entranced early on by Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. His background in sound engineering comes in handy to the band. As does his love of cooking!</p>
